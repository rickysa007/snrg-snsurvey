Supernova Reading Group:  SN survey

The code is a little bit messy right now but it gets the job done for now, will tidy it up after finishing its function, sorry about that

You can download the data using the Google drive link in the Google doc, or just feel free to download any data you want in the Open Supernova Catalog in .json

You may not be able to import the data correctly due to the incorrect directory, just change it to your directory where the data is stored and it should be fine
